# Website Blocker

## Overview
This Python script aims to block access to specified websites during certain hours of the day by modifying the system's hosts file. It operates based on a predefined list of websites to block and runs continuously, periodically checking the current time to determine whether to block or unblock the sites.

## Code Components

### Variables
- `sites_to_block`: A list containing the URLs of websites to be blocked.
- `Linux_host` and `Window_host`: Paths to the hosts file for Linux and Windows operating systems respectively.
- `default_hoster`: The path to the hosts file based on the current operating system.
- `redirect`: The IP address to which the blocked websites will be redirected.

### Functions
- `block_websites(start_hour, end_hour)`: The main function that continuously monitors the current time and blocks/unblocks websites accordingly. It checks whether the current time falls within the specified range (`start_hour` to `end_hour`) to determine whether to block or unblock the sites.

## Code Execution Flow
1. **Initialization**:
   - Determines the default hosts file path based on the operating system.
   - Defines the list of websites to block.

2. **Main Execution Loop**:
   - Continuously checks the current time.
   - If the current time is within the specified range, it blocks the specified websites by adding entries to the hosts file.
   - If the current time is outside the specified range, it removes the entries for the blocked websites from the hosts file, effectively unblocking them.
   - Sleeps for a short duration (3 seconds in this case) between iterations.

## Conclusion
- The code provides a simple yet effective method to control access to specific websites during certain hours of the day.
- It utilizes the hosts file manipulation technique, which is commonly used for blocking access to websites at the system level.
- However, there are some considerations and potential improvements:
  - **Platform Compatibility**: The code currently supports Linux and Windows operating systems. Extending support to other platforms may enhance its usability.
  - **User Interface**: Adding a simple user interface or configuration file could make the script more user-friendly.
  - **Error Handling**: While the script handles permission errors gracefully, adding more comprehensive error handling could improve robustness.
